# Str√∏mpris API

This is a simple API for getting the electricity prices in Norway for today and tomorrow.

## Usage

The endpoints `/today` and `/tomorrow`:

```json
[
  {
    "baseCost": 0.23382,
    "cost": 0.37882,
    "start": "2024-11-04T23:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z",
    "numeral": 0,
    "weekday": 2,
    "discounted": true,
    "isHighCost": false
  },
  {
    "baseCost": 0.24769,
    "cost": 0.39269,
    "start": "2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-11-05T01:00:00.000Z",
    "numeral": 1,
    "weekday": 2,
    "discounted": true,
    "isHighCost": false
  }
  // ...
]
```

You can also get only the `HIGH` price hours by setting the query parameter `only=high` (the number of high hours is configured in main.js `NUMBER_OF_HIGH_PRICE_HOURS` which is set to `8` by default).

Example `/today?only=high`:

```json
[
  {
    "baseCost": 0.28058,
    "cost": 0.50558,
    "start": "2024-11-05T07:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-11-05T08:00:00.000Z",
    "numeral": 8,
    "weekday": 2,
    "discounted": false,
    "isHighCost": true
  },
  {
    "baseCost": 0.31634,
    "cost": 0.54134,
    "start": "2024-11-05T08:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2024-11-05T09:00:00.000Z",
    "numeral": 9,
    "weekday": 2,
    "discounted": false,
    "isHighCost": true
  }
  // ...
]
```

Lastly, if you're like me, you probably only care about the 24-hour numerical hour value of the `HIGH` price hours, in which case, this is what you want:

`/today?only=high&numerals=true`:

```json
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18]
```

With this list, it's so easy to make an automation in Home Assistant (with the use of the REST API sensor) which turns off water boilers at the most expensive hours of the day.
